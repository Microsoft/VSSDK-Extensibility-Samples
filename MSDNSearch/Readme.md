**Project Files**

* **MSDNSearchPackage.cs**

This file contains the ExtensionPointPackage implementation. Declares the
supported extension points (the Quick Launch search provider). It also is
responsible for declaring About Box registration data.

* **MSDNSearchProvider.cs**

This file contains the search provider implementation. The class implements
the IVsSearchProvider interface that enables Quick Launch integration.

* **MSDNSearchResult.cs**

This class represents a search result from MSDN Search category. It exposes
properties such as DisplayText, Tooltip, and implements the action to be
executed when the search result is selected by the user.

* **MSDNSearchTask.cs**

This class derives from Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.VsSearchTask and
implements the task used to perform the actual searches. It queries the MSDN
online server, process the returned RSS feed and creates search results to be
displayed in the Quick Launch popup.

* **VSPackage.resx**

This file is used to support localized strings and images for About Box
registration
