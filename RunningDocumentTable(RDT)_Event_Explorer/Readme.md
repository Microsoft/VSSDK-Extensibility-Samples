**Description**

This sample demonstrates how to create an explorer that logs Running Document
Table (RDT) events. Selecting an event from the grid displays its properties
in the **Properties** window.

Goals:

  * Provide a tool to explore the RDT that follows recommended design patterns 
  * Log RDT events on a grid 
  * Select RDT event details from the grid to view them in the **Properties** window 
  * Filter logged events from the **Tools &gt; Options** page 
  * Implement a toolbar in the RDT window with control options 
  * Tool window and dialog page share a singleton instance of options via automation 



This sample has a package (_RdtEventExplorerPkg_) and a tool window
(_RDTEventWindowPane_). The tool window hosts a UserControl
(_RdtEventControl_). The options are set by a dialog page
(_RdtEventOptionsDialog_) and filter the RDT events (derived from
GenericEvent).

The explorer window hosts a toolbar and displays all unfiltered RDT events in
a grid. Selecting an event in the grid displays its properties in the
**Properties** window.
